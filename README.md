# Flappy-Bird
Hey folks, this is a small flappy bird game I created using Python and pygame. 
Later on I converted the python script into a .exe(executable) file to make it platform independent, meaning that the user does not need to have Python installed on their computer in order to run the script. So anyone can download all the files from here and can play the game on their systems.
